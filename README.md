# Linear Regression Visualized: Building Intuition Behind Ordinary Least Squares

Leverage the power of Manim to bring OLS regression to life. Inspired by Grant Sanderson‚Äôs (3Blue1Brown) videos‚Äîwhose animations got me through linear algebra, calculus, neural networks, cryptography, and more‚Äîthis repo houses a 10-minute teaching demo I built for my Ateneo statistics class. Watch data points, candidate lines, and error bars animate as we discover the best-fit line by minimizing the sum of squared errors.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Geometric Intuition**: Watch the algebraic formula for OLS come alive as lines and points move in sync.  
- **Step-by-Step Animation**: From raw scatter to final regression line, each stage is animated.  
- **Interactive Parameters**: Easily tweak slope and intercept to see real-time error changes.  
- **Reusable Snippets**: Clean Manim scenes that you can adapt for gradient descent, matrix solutions, and beyond.
